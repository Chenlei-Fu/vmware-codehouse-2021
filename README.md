# VMware CodeHouse 2021
This document will serve as guidance for attendees and mentors of VMware CodeHouse 2021.

The goal of the hackathon will be to create an application that furthers STEM education and/or Diversity & Inclusion. This application should leverage OAuth 2.0 framework for authorization and should be well documented so it can be shared as an example application after the hackathon.

# Required reading
To make sure you are comfortable with the framework we will be using, please read through the following documents well in advance:

1. What is [Oauth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/).
2. [Example](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/server-side-apps/example-flow/) illustrating authorization code grant type. 
3. Go through at least one of the "Oauth Flow" in [Oauth Playground by OKTA](https://www.oauth.com/playground/).

# Completion of pre-req tasks
Once you have completed these tasks, make a pull request to this repository with a Markdown file in this format:

```firstname-lastname.md```

```I've finished reading through the pre-req docs and finished one of the Oauth flow in the above mentioned playground.```
